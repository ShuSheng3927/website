<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >This notebook includes concepts for the topics of Probability Theory and Statistics at
an early undergraduate level. The note is primarily written to help with my own
understanding and studying of these topics, but it should be able to help others too. I
will include my own interpretation in the notebook, and along the way, I will be
addressing the historical backgrounds of some key ideas to make the Maths even more
entertaining.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >I referred to many sources and I do not take much credit from this work. They will not be
cited separately through the course of the notebook, but I will list the main ones
below.

<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Mathematics textbooks are normally written in a the more rigorous
‘Deﬁnition-Theorem-Corollary-Lemma’ structure. It is easy to follow that same structure here
but I did not. Although there are a lot of beneﬁts and elegance with that format, I do not
think it will be a good ﬁt for the purpose of this notebook, as I aim to focus more on the
explanations and connections between concepts rather than solely stating and proving them.
The drawback will be that concepts are harder to spot if one is not reading from
start to end, but there is the Index page at the end to help. It should not be too
bad.
                                                                                

                                                                                
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >In terms of the content of the notebook, it mainly aims to cover the material of the ﬁrst two
years for a degree course of Mathematics and Statistics. In the US system, this should be
enough for all the undergraduate level Mathematics and Statistics, since Measure Theory is
usually a graduate course and that is essential to study the Measure-Theoretic Probability
Theory.
</p><!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >For Probability Theory, it normally has three components - probability theory (dealing with
distributions, expectations, etc.), stochastic process (dealing with stochastic models) and
stochastic calculus. The ﬁrst two components will be covered here, where the stochastic
process component is covered to a lesser degree. Normally, stochastic process at this level can
be a course on its own, normally called ’applied probability’ or just ’stochastic process’. There
are a lot of real-life applications of stochastic processes, like Renewal Theory and
Branching Processes. These topics, although very interesting, may not appeal to a wider
audience and they can be picked up fairly easily for interested readers after knowing
the more fundamental materials in this notebook. Also, I ﬁnd it very hard, and
almost impossible, to have a thorough discussion of stochastic calculus without
more advanced Mathematical tools, which is why I omit any discussion on that
here.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >For the Statistics component, it should be enough Statistics material for anyone using
Statistical tools but not involved in Statistics research. Just like how Probability Theory has
many other applications, Statistics, too, have those applications, like Social Statistics and
Biostatistics. These topics will not be covered, to make the notebook more concentrated.
Another reason is that I am no expert in these topics, and I am not conﬁdent enough to write
about them yet.
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Normally, programming languages like R and Python will be studied to help with some
computations in Statistics and Probability Theory. Although they are extremely useful and are
the trend in this era of booming computing powers, we will omit these topics. I feel these
topics should be treated separately, for a programming notebook, instead of being discussed in
a Maths and Statistics notebook.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >For readers of this notebook, I do recommend you to use this as a complementary material to
a standard textbooks. This is due to the fact that this notebook does not include any exercises
and problem sets to the topics, which are essential for a thorough understanding of any
concepts. I would even recommend the readers to be inspired by this notebook and
write their own version, since diﬀerent people have diﬀerent preference and style of
learning.
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Since I am no expert in these topics and am learning them myself not too long ago, I am
sure there are things that I write wrongly or explain poorly. Typos and grammar
errors are bound to happen too, such things will exist no matter how often one
reviews the work. In such cases, I hope the readers can contact me to point out these
issues or discussion alternative ways to discuss the concepts. My email address is:

</p><!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, I would like to express my most sincere appreciation to those Mathematicians and
                                                                                

                                                                                
Statisticians who have made contributions to the ﬁeld. All of us are standing on their
shoulders, and hopefully in the future, we can join them and oﬀer our shoulders for the future
generations.
