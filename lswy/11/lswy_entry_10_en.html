<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I would say, quite frequently these days, that a result is interesting and elegant. You may ask how did I make that statement. Well, there is no strict criteria for me to say something is elegant. When I look at it and understand a bit of what it is saying, these things appear in my mind right away. It is like when you see a good-looking person on the street, you normally will just instantaneously find him or her beautiful without examining the look through rounds and rounds of assessments. Such things just pops up naturally. Of course, you can find ways to somewhat determine the aesthetic, like using symmetry of the facial structure or some quantifiable measures about the body shape, but these things are not that intuitive. There are things that you JUST KNOW. This is the same case about results in Mathematics I guess. No one stops you from judging a piece of result by looking at how impactful it is or what profound techniques it employs, but that is just not the intuitive way. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I have been talking with my personal tutor earlier today. Since the term is going to end, he decided to have a chat with every student under him to go over what has happened for the term. I gave a quick review of the things I have done for this term so far, and wrote them done. The discussion was mostly based on that list. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">My personal tutor told me that he is trying to think about ways for me to take more advanced courses, as based on the things I am learning on my own now, school are too easy. He is afraid that I will get bored. I told him that that will be perfect, but since UK, or at least UCL, is quite rigid, unlike schools in US or other places. My point is, if it is too troublesome then just screw it. He said he will try to ask for me anyway. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Also, he is recommending me to try to audit for some of the courses next term, and since the people in the department may be less busy these days, they may have time to adjust such things for me. I am not sure if it is possible, but I will see how things go as time progresses. He asked me to take a look at the website of King’s and Imperial to see if they allow people form other universities to take courses from them. He told me that there are students from King’s who are joining his class, so there might be a way to do that. For King’s, I could not find the detailed information for the modules they are offering on their websites, but I do know people who is studying Maths and King’s and I could ask her if I really want to. Imperial put these information online. To be honest, I do not think I will need to take a course, because my pace is not going to be the same as the pace of a module, and I think I normally learn at a faster pace. Although, I really hate troubles and all those logistic things. My personal tutor also mentioned that it will be nice if I can get some credit from taking these modules, and show on my resume. I don’t really mind such things too much and I care more about learning the knowledge. It will be great to have them, of course, but if they are less troublesome then maybe I will be more willing to do. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Regarding the content of my self-studying, my personal tutor asked me to take a look at topology and geometry too. The three basic branches of Mathematics are Analysis, Algebra and Geometry / Topology. I have been studying quite a bit for the first two, but almost know nothing about the third. At this moment of time, I am not too interested in Geometry and Topology, and I do not know any interesting (at least in my view) results of it.  From the point of having a solid foundation, it will worthwhile to lean them, at least I should not be totally ignorant about them. There are way too much overlapping and intersections between branches in modern Mathematics, and not having a firm foundation may lead of negative consequences in the future. He recommended me a book on algebraic number theory and I will be able to read that after I finish Galois Theory. He also mentioned that I should take a look at baby Rudin. I said I have read it before, but I do think I need to read it again as I did not understand much back then. Apart from those, I told him about how I study. Mainly just keep reading until I could not understand, then I will go back a couple of pages and read again. I will do some exercises sometimes, but not a lot. He told me that I have to do exercises, as there are things that you can only learn from practicing. Of course, there is no need to do ALL the questions, but maybe half of them will do the job. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Oh, and he also briefly mentioned about graduating early. He said by my speed I would be able to finish all the undergraduate material in one or two years. I don’t really care about that, and I told him if I have studied enough then I can read papers and do research - there will always be something for me to do anyway. He agreed. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Anyway, I no long pay attention to my own progress and that of the university. These two lines are independent already. I will just follow the rules and regulations of the university since they are not taking too much time from me anyway. Also, since we are having online school, I do not watch the lectures anyway. I will just read the notes and do the homework. That is quite convenient. My own progress will be driven solely by my interest. I will learn whatever I want to learn and not care about what branch of Mathematics I am going to go for later on. I will only make that choice when I have to (lets say maybe when I apply for master or PhD). Of course, I will study a bit of Topology and Geometry, but the priorities for them are not too high. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I think I have written a bit too much for this part. I really DO have a lot to say about Mathematics. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I have been reading quite a bit of Algebra recently. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">A lot of the concepts of Algebra were quite hard to grasp when I first learned them (that was the last year of high school when my Math teacher, Mr Raghu, gave me a book on Introduction to Abstract Algebra). I do not know what is really going on. A lot of the things are just throwing definitions in your face, and tell us that things are defined based on this condition and that condition. I barely had anything that can be called “understanding” back then, and I was quite busy during that time so I stopped quite soon. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Later on, after reading some Linear Algebra, I get more understanding when I go back and read Abstract Algebra. That was by the end of the holiday before University starts, and I was reading Algebra by Artin. That book combines linear and abstract, and things make more sense to me. To be fair, my understanding back then was quite rough too, but at least I remembered things for a longer time period, rather than forgot right after. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Now I have read quite a bit of Abstract Algebra, and I have read all the content needed for the lower Undergraduate years. Of course, I would not say I understand them, but only be familiarise with them. I told my personal tutor the same thing, and I said “Understanding is a strong word”. He agreed on that too. Now, I am reading something more advanced, the Galois Theory. I think a lot of things that I learn now can be understood easily, like many times I have an image of things in my mind. Not in the way that I have some concrete examples for everything, it is hard to explain, but I am just able to read and understand them better. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I think Algebra has plenty of elegant content. Algebra itself is a study of structure. The structure between objects, the structure between structures, the structure between relationships, etc. I will not give actual Mathematical examples. If you have learned them you will know what I am saying. It is just hard to explain these concepts properly here in a few sentences. Anyway, a lot of results in Algebra can be stated simply, but with a rich content behind it. I like that, and that seems fun to me. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">On the contrary, I have been learning some differential equations in school and they seem quite tedious. A lot of calculations with little conceptual, conclusive information. I do not enjoy those that much. On that note, doing Math & Stat helps me to avoid taking courses like Kinematics. I do not think I will enjoy them. But they are quite similar to high school Maths, which is why many of my peers seem to like those. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Talking about peers, I will go on a tangent for a bit. I have been seeing people in the Math group chat talking about liking some module and disliking other modules, finding some easy and other hard. I find those comments a bit funny. They are basically making judgements on a whole branch of Mathematics based on so little information about them, and they will inevitably make some poor comments. I am curious to see how they will react to those comments later on when they explore more. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I think I did the same for this part too, commenting on things that I do not know too well of. But whatever. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">How do Applied Statisticians do Research? (Also uploaded under Blog)
</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Disclaimer: The following was based on second-hand information and my observation on how research are completed in Applied Statistics, so there are chances for them to be inaccurate. </p>  

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Statistics is an applied discipline by itself, and applied statistics is even more related to problems of real life. I have been listening to talks for the past weeks, and I have been talking with lecturers and professors of the department who are doing Applied Statistics on how their research are carried out. I will summarise some of the more interesting and important points below. </p>  

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Normally, research of biostatistics and many other kinds of Applied Statistics are not completed individually. They are mostly collaboration with researchers of other fields, and statisticians will help with the statistics component of the problem. This means, a lot of the times, people will come up to Applied Statisticians and ask them some Statistics questions, then they will try to find solutions to them. Some of them are simple, but on occasions they will get strange questions. Then, they will go back and check the literature to see if there are any other similar questions solved in the past by others. On an even rarer occasion, there is no solution to that question, and they will try to solve them themselves and hope to find something that are more generally applicable. That is how research for Applied Statisticians are carried out. This is also why they tend to have a lot of publications, as they are often serving a more supporting role in a research project and those work will not take too much time while making their names appear on the list of authors. </p>  

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">UCL has a great medical school and neuroscience department, and there are many hospitals around the campus. This makes collaborations really easy for those doing medical statistics and biostatistics, which attracts a lot of researchers of biostatistics. This is also why there are a lot of people doing biostatistics at the UCL Statistical Science department. </p>  

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Research needs funding, but these money do not come out from nowhere. This means Applied Statisticians will need to apply for research grants and collaborate with firms from time to time. These kind of research will be more passive, as the topic of the research is restricted by the requirements and goals of the firm or the fund. A lot of the projected funded by the NHS have to solve questions that they find useful and important, or solve their problems directly. The good side is you do not need to worry too much about the topic, you only need to find workable solutions. </p>  

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Apart from the two ways above, you will naturally come across many questions that are worth solving as you do more research. They might be extensions to your previous work. Sometimes, your solution to a specific question may inspire you to develop it further and prove more rigorously, and apply at other scenarios. Sometimes, such work will create new methodologies, models, or concepts in Statistics. Also, you may think that some of your work may seem not very useful at that time, but a couple of years later became heavily used by people from other fields and have significant applications. For example, Alan Hawkes discovered the Hawkes Process thinking it is not very useful and other researchers did not pay much attention at that time. However, around ten years later, a college of him doing Financial Mathematics told him that a lot of people are using that model now. He then went back and studied about that model further. Now, this process has been applied in Machine Learning too. This example was told to me from a long time collaborator of Hawkes, David Colquhoun. He came for my talk on random walk and told me about them when we chatted before the start of the talk.</p>  

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Of course, these are how research is done for more mature researchers. Most PhDs are only working with their advisors on the questions that the advisor thinks are worth solving and can be solved by the student. After doing such research for a while, the PhD candidates will then slowly try to figure out how to do research more independently. </p>  







<h2 id="Wondering Years" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Wondering Years </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The occurrence of many events in life is not really affected by your behaviour. Many things are just random, and you will not be able to explain why certain things happen. The people you will meet, the decision you make, all those things that you think you do with a subjective will may merely but a series of coincidence. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">That is why there is little point in making detailed plan about the future. Plan should only be serving the purpose of suggestion and guidance, instead of blocking your possibilities. Overthinking about long term things will sometimes bring you unnecessary worries. Just live each day and make yourself as happy as possible everyday. Fate is just a huge nest knitted by individual choices. There is no globally optimal choice in reality, at most locally optimal. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">If things go your way, then just accept and be happy about them. If not, we should accept them too. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Regardless, if the process is enjoyable and fun, then this will not be a wasted journey. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I think there are two kinds of “birth”. One is the biological birth that everyone will experience. The other is the spiritual birth. When one starts to think about the purpose of their life, when one thinks about what are the things they want for themselves rather than following the words of the public and others, and one finds a satisfactory answer to those questions, then that person is born again. They start to be themselves, rather than a puppet controlled by the outside world and others. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The difficulty of spiritual birth is no less than that of the biological birth. Since the ancient times, there have been a variety of difficulties for women to give birth to children, and the level of hardship is not changing by much from past to now. The only difference is that modern medicine is able to avoid and resolve most of them. The spiritual birth is packed with hardships too. When people wonder about the meaning of life, they may think that there is no meaning and everything is pointless and insignificant. The consequence of that is they think there is no difference between life and death. When life is more intolerable, they may choose to go with death, as nothing matters to them. If that result is not being changed, it means the person is dead, at least spiritually. Also, when people search for meaning, they may view external objects as the source of meaning, and mistakenly think the rules of others are the rules of themselves. That is the spiritual dystocia. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Ancient Greeks create the early form of science. With the effort and developments of the people afterwards, we have modern medicine and that help us to make biological birth as a relatively safe task. The Greeks create Philosophy too. Although it is studied and developed by people afterwards, it is still far from being the modern medicine of the spiritual world. The spiritual birth is still too risky. A lot of people have yet to be fertilised spiritually until the end of their physical life. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">To me, I am enlightened by Stephen Hawking. I was stuck in the swamp of nihilism the same year he passed away and I could not find the gem of “purpose”. The unfinished work of Professor Hawking was published on the same year, and I got a copy for myself. The line in his book, “We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.”, wakened me and bring light to the void of my spiritual world. Further nurturing is needed after enlightenment. I am nurtured by Richard Feynman. His talks and autobiography taught me how to think, how to view various things, what is important, what is absurd. I will not be born spiritually without them.
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">It is quite interesting though - I am doing Maths but I am “born” because of two Physicists.
