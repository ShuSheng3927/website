<h4 style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'" align="center">7 March 2021</h4>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">It has been more than a month since I last updated. I have either been working on something or having no mood of writing during that time. Anyway, it just gets delayed again and again. </p>

<h2 id="London" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">London </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I went to Hyde Park last Friday. It was a beautiful day - sunny, little cloud, moderate temperature of about 10 plus degrees. I finished all my classes at 2pm, and already completed all the work that I need to finish, so I decided to go for a rare walk. I travel almost only by walking over the past half year here in London, which restricts the range of travelling. Apart from the region I am living in, the furthest places I have been to are Chinatown and the London Bridge. Hyde Park is next to Imperial, which will take roughly forty minutes of walking, so I never really have the opportunity to visit. That day was a combination of nice weather and good timing, and therefore I finally paid my visit.</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">There are large spans of lawn there, with many people having picnics. I was just wondering around. There is a long rectangular shape lake in the middle, with swans and ducks in it. This reminds me of Beihai Park in Beijing, which I visited once a few years ago on a winter afternoon. I wonder how Beihai will look like in spring. Will it be the same as this?</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">It is wonderful to go for a walk on such a nice day. I have been having my mind empty the whole time, which is extremely rare. I am overjoyed by the pleasant atmosphere. Normally my mind will be filled with things when I am walking or do things, and there is no way for me to put a pause to that. That involuntary emptiness was great, I get to be indulged in the here and now, instead of recalling the past or pondering about the future.</p>

<h2 id="Statistics" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Statistics</h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I have been reading about Statistics recently. I once asked my lecturer for Practical Statistics on what to learn next for more advanced topics of Statistics, like high-dimensional Statistics, and what text to use. He recommended me to read “The Elements of Statistical Learning”, and said that is a good way to begin learning some high-dimensional and some machine learning. I read the first two chapters, and I felt the book skips a lot of derivations, which makes it hard to read. I found an alternative text online, the “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning”, hopefully it could be helpful. I am now learning about regression, and I tried to construct some images in my mind for geometric intuition and understandings, and tried to read over the derivations. This is what I did when I was learning pure Mathematics, and that is now almost subconscious. Also, I find it really hard to learn by watching videos, and it feels much easier to learn by reading texts. I get distracted really easily when I watch videos, and it is hard to retain anything in my mind. I am not sure how this will affect my learning when I go back to in person classes, but hopefully the environment of a classroom will be of some help. </p>

<h2 id="Wondering Years" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Wondering Years </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">In my last year of high school, I have a lot of skepticisms about volunteering. For application to US universities, the so-called “community service” is very important. Clearly, if you want to apply to a good US college, you, like it or not, have to do these things. I was not particularly interested in such matters. It is by no means saying that I am stingy about my help, it is just that I felt I am betraying other people’s kindness if I do such things with such clear pragmatic objectives. Of course, I have done a few such volunteering, but I did them knowing that I will not turn any of them into pragmatic uses. I once did a tutoring work to children at a local church, but I soon realised they have no desire to learn and have knowledge, and is not in any need for external help, so I stopped going after a while. The volunteering works I did for my college applications are merely wrapping the term “charity” around commercial projects, and donate all the profits, so that they can be carried out in the school environment. These are the only kind of charity work that I can do without guilt. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">It was in that kind of background that I came to a larger skepticism towards voluntary work in general. I felt those volunteers are not doing those things for what they claim to be “helping others”, but only obtaining gains from the actions of helping, which give them joy and meaning of doing such things. The gains I mentioned include but are not limited to the kindness of those who received the help and the reactions of others when they hear those volunteers have done voluntary work previously. Essentially, those actions are “selfish”, instead of the altruist acts they claimed to be doing. This cause me to find volunteering absurd. There have also been frequent news about how volunteering were just publicity stunts, or profit driven projects, which further solidified my opinions. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">My current personal view towards such matter is that I will do them with claims to be pragmatic, and I will not use any blank slogans to glorify my acts. At the same time, I will tell myself that I am doing them since I get joy from the action, or just for my personal goals. This logic, at least to me, is a self-sustained one. Since I have no “college applications” to partially force me to do such things, I could make my decision independently. I am still skeptical about volunteering, but like many other things, as long as I am not heavily involved, I will just remain silent, and be a “silent majority”. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This may not be my unique question. For someone who lives at the same place since born, he or she will not question their knowledge of that place. However, how much do they really know? Will they know anything more insightful than the results after a single search of the place online? These questions are seldom thought about by us. </p>
