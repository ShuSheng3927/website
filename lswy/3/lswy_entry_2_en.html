<br>

<h2 id="London" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">London </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">For buying groceries in London, there are a lot of options and different types of places that one can go to. There are the corner shops (similar to convenient stores) and supermarkets. Among supermarkets, there are mostly two kinds - the express and the standard. The express ones are normally with smaller size and less varieties of products, whereas the standard ones are a lot bigger. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Within the broad category of supermarkets, there are different brands and each have a different price level. The brand with the cheapest products is Lidl. They mostly sell things at a very low price and they have cheap products that one cannot find elsewhere. The quality is not as good, but consider the price, they are plenty of good deals. Above this level will be Tescos and Sainsbury’s. There are a lot of promotion going on every now and then, and their products are normally averagely priced. So, if you have a bit more money and you want to have some good quality things, these two are the options. Beyond these ones will be Waitrose. Waitrose is the most expensive out of the several brands, and they normally have a wide variety of goods. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">For the same product that appears in the supermarkets of all three levels, if it costs £1 at Sainsbury, then it will be around £0.90 at Lidl and £1.10 at Waitrose. That is a rough idea of the difference in prices of these three. The corner shops are normally opened by Indian or Pakistani immigrants, and their products are normally more expensive. The main distinction between them and the supermarkets is that they do not check the buyers’ ID when they purchase alcohol or other age-restricted products. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">These are just based on my observations so far, and they might need amendments as I learn more and deeper about these things.  </p>


<h2 id="Statistics" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Statistics</h2>

<br>


<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Just met my personal tutor for my time at UCL. The meeting was supposed to be for everyone who is under him but it ends up with only me joining the chat. So we just had a short conversation instead. The tutor is a lecturer working on analytical number theory, which is applying tools of Analysis in the study of Number Theory. More specifically, he is working with the L-functions and one example of the L-function is the Riemann zeta function that is involved in the Riemann hypothesis. I told him about what I have been studying recently and what I did over the 9-month break. He seems to be slightly impressed and he is definitely sure what I am doing, as he used some of the same textbooks when he was an undergrad. He also told me that if I have any questions regarding the course or my own studying, I can look for him. In addition, he agreed to help me to look for potential research opportunities in the area of probability theory and statistics - I hope he does not forget about this. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Had my first in-person tutorial today. The building I was at seems to be quite new and the facilities are in good condition. Some of the other buildings do not look this glamorous, at least on the outside. The tutorial is on Analysis and it was held by my personal tutor, which is just a happy coincidence. Since it was the first tutorial, there was not a lot of questions and I felt the situation is a bit awkward so I asked one question. Later on I engaged quite a bit, which I am afraid was too much. But well, what has been done is done, and there is nothing much I can do or alter other people’s opinions. Looking forward to the next tutorial.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Here at UCL, a lot of the coursework are done in group instead of individually. We were divided into a big tutorial group of 15 people and 5 smaller groups of 3 each. I am in a group with two other French people. I tried to push them slightly to keep them somewhat on my pace, so I can get things done as soon as possible. Not sure how this will work out in the long run though. I hope I do not annoy them too soon since I will be working with them for the rest of this term and probably this year. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The tutorial for Method was carried out by a Russian professor, with strong Russian accent. During the tutorial, the professor went through the Einstein summation notation and elaborated further. These things were not under the syllabus and the lectures. Most of the other people, based on my personal observation, did not even finish all the lectures. This means, the additional material, along with the strong Russian accent, make most of the people very lost, which is probably why I am the only one engaging and discussing with the professor during the lecture. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The content is actually very interesting, if you have studied enough to know the background and be good at English to the point of understanding the Russian accent. The motivation behind the Einstein summation is because when Einstein was working on 4-D space-time, things are in 4-by-4 matrices and they are hard to compute without the introduction of these things. Also, this way of writing also helps us to make the modern day computing easier, as the complexity of additions and multiplications are much lower than matrix computations. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">So, I think I was not the only one engaging as others rather not be involved, but just that they have not event learnt the required material to be able to engage in the conversation. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The problem with the STAT0002 course is that, although the lecturer is attempting to make the content more interesting using real-life examples and papers, with a lack of sufficient fundamental knowledge of the course, a lot of the students will be lost and they will have no idea of what is going on, let along to appreciate the attempt to make the content more interesting. I  think a better attempt will be to start with some fundamental knowledge and bring in these more interesting examples maybe at halfway of the module. In that case, the content may be better understood and appreciated. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Got accepted by the Investment society’s mentorship programme. It is good that I got accepted into a somewhat competitive programme (50% acceptance rate according to their website). I got rejected by the mentorship programme at another society, the Economics Finance society. But well, one is enough, or else it will be repetitive anyway. Anyway, I do not really give much attention and effort into such things for internships, jobs and etc. They are at most a back-up plan in case academia fails me. I still very much want to do Maths and research, I am getting so much fun from doing Maths these days, and I really want to just have more of that. </p>

<h2 id="Wondering Years" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Wondering Years </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When one says he or she loves someone, it does not mean that one thinks that person is perfect. Instead, it means one chooses to accept and embrace that person’s flaws and appreciate his or her strengths. This, to me, is equivalent to the love of one’s country. It, by no means, implies they believe their country is flawless, but it really means they still appreciate what the country has for he or she despite those flaws. This is my interpretation of patriotism - some sort of romance. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When some people are attempting so hard to become a part of a different culture, it is as if they are trying to sew non homogeneous pieces of flesh onto their body, making them look like a living Frankenstein. On the other hand, if you decide to appreciate your own culture and the culture of the others, learning the good parts and eliminating the bad parts. This is adaptation, and you become a better version of yourself - rather than mutation where you are not even yourself. </p>
