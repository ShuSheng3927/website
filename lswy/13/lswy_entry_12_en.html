<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Skipped. </p>

<h2 id="Statistics" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Statistics</h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I only have four modules this term. Two Mathematics and two Statistics. The two Statistics modules are the extension of last term’s ones. There was little change, except for maybe a change in tutor. For Mathematics, I only have Analysis and Method this term, and there is no more Algebra. Actually, I quite want to take Algebra, but I was not allowed to take extra modules. I asked this question last term, and received no positive replies. Analysis is just the extension of last term’s work. Nothing complicated. Just some theorems of differentiations and integrations, with some Riemann integrations. For Method, we will be learning Python for the first half of the term. I learned Python on my own when I was in secondary school. That is the same language I used when I was interning as a programmer at a startup during my high school. The seance half of the term will be learning some vector calculus, and it was taught by the head of the department. I was told that she teaches really well - we shall see. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The lecturer of Analysis is again a Russian. To be more specific, Soviet. he was working at some institute of USSR during the Soviet Union time, and he left for UK when it collapsed. He mentioned in the first lecture that his teaching will be identical to his lecture notes, so it is possible to learn everything by just reading the notes. For Method, there was no classes for the first half of the term, only some weekly exercises. They are easy to do and not taking up much of my time. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The two modules of Statistics are Probability and Statistics, and Practical Statistics. The first one is about some theories in Statistics, and the later on is mostly focusing on the R language. The lecturer for Probability and Statistics is the lecturer of Practical Statistics from last term, and we had a new lecturer for Practical Statistics. He seems to be quite an accomplished researcher, as most of his recent publications are on the top journals of the field. I am unable to understand the exact work he does, but those names of journals are very impressive on their own. He is mostly focusing on high dimensional Statistics. Although I am not too excited about Statistics, I am still very interested to learn more about them, since I do not want to waste what my degree is offering me. I went to his office hour this week and asked some questions. Other than some that are more closely related to the actual work, I asked him things on false data and manipulated codes. I am actually quite curious about these things, as I have seen numerous arguments and scandals about those matters online. Since there is a profession out there, I have to ask him. He provided me with satisfactory answers, a lot of them are not known to me previously. I felt I can spend some time and effort on his classes, as that will definitely not be a waste of my time. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Those are pretty much all about school stuff. For the things of self-studying, I had read most of the point-set topology and have a good understanding of the main concepts. They are sufficient for me to proceed with the next step of studying of Topology. I am now learning the introductory material on Algebraic Topology. There was one module called Topology and Group offered at UCL which pretty much taught these materials. Although that lecturer is no longer at UCL and that module is no longer offered, he put the content online so I could access them fairly easily. I think it is much easier to learn by watching videos compare to reading a textbook on your own. I am not sure if this is because he taught well or because that is the reality. I mostly learn by reading textbooks and I do not go to much classes so I am not too certain. For now I am going to learn Algebraic Topology, and I will read some textbooks after I watched the module to have better understandings. I would learn more Algebra afterwards.

<h2 id="Wondering Years" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Wondering Years </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I would be going back to Shanghai quite frequently during my time at Singapore. Every time I went back, I had some slight sense of unfamiliarity, as if I have little relationship with that piece of land. The longer I stayed in Singapore, the stronger that sense became. Maybe time weakened the bond between me and my homeland, or maybe that bond never existed and was a mere illusion of mine. I have no way to find out.</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I came to better awareness of that sense of unfamiliarity during some of the discussions with my friends from school before they came to Shanghai to travel. I realised that I have close to no knowledge about most places there, and I was not sure where are the places worthy of going. Of course, tourist attractions are not supposed to be frequently visited by locals, but it is still a bit extreme to be fully ignorant. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">At first, I thought the unfamiliarity will fade as I go to more of those places. Unfortunately, after visiting to these places, I had no significant memory of them in my mind. These places felt like any other corners on the world, and have little connection with the term “Shanghai”. I am still unfamiliar with the land. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This may not be my unique question. For someone who lives at the same place since born, he or she will not question their knowledge of that place. However, how much do they really know? Will they know anything more insightful than the results after a single search of the place online? These questions are seldom thought about by us. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When I was in Shanghai, even though I was walking on solid land, I felt that I was floating. The roots are broken, or maybe never existed before. I may not even be the only person floating - the entire city may be floating at the same time, flying off from the ground like released balloons. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The gravity of urbanisation and globalisation sucked away any culture and characteristics unique to the land. At the same time, they have an amazing filling power, stuffing every empty corner with chained brands and sky scrapers. Everywhere becomes almost identical. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">What could be catching the strings of flying balloons? We do not seem to have a solution. </p>
