<h4 style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'" align="center">8 November 2020</h4>

<br>

<h2 id="London" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">London </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The second round of lockdown began earlier this week. It will last for a month and will end sometime before Christmas. This lockdown, to be fair, does not affect my life at all. The supermarkets and many restaurants are still open, and the university will still continue with the pattern of teaching as before, so none of the regulations of lockdown is affecting me personally. If this lockdown can reduce the cases by a bit and slow the spread of COVID to a certain degree, then it will be good. </p>

<h2 id="Statistics" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Statistics</h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Listened to a talk by the head of Statistics department on his research and his experience with them. It was quite informative, and he mentioned about some of the more interesting work he did in the past. Basically, his research interest is in applied statistics, and especially in the application in climate change. One point he made was that it is surprising to realise how poorly statistics are being applied and how things in real life are functioning in such an unorganised order. During the Q&A session, I asked him if he thinks the work on applied statistics is going to benefit the span of knowledge of statistics, as I am wondering if those work are going to be meaning to the field of Statistics or not. The answer was positive, and he mentioned that one of the examples he showed provided some new understanding of statistics too. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">During the same talk, the professor talked about one of the paper he was working on, which is about the climate change prediction. He outlined the question that he needs to solve - there are several kinds of formulas to predict the change of average temperature, but there is no best or worst one and each gives varying results. He also mentioned that it is not useful to average out all the values even with weightage, as they are each good or bad at different aspects. So, I naturally think about how the final prediction is produced, which is by putting values into a pre-designed function. If we adjust the inputs to an optimal point, we will get an optimal result right? We can just take the weighted average of each component values then substitute that into the final prediction formula to get our most ideal prediction. That was what I thought and that was what I asked right after. Somewhat to my surprise, that is what the professor did for that paper and that, apparently, got those scientists stuck for about 10 years. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I gave a talk today on the topic of discrete-time Random walk on Z^d lattice for the UCL Undergraduate Math Colloquium. It was nothing too mathematical challenging, but it does provide some interesting results. They give rise to the statement “A drunk man will always get home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever.” I learnt the content of this talk during the holiday when I was studying probability theory. They are contained in my Probability Theory and Statistics notebook as well. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Although I have already learnt and written the notes for this topic, it still took one and a half day for me to finish making the slides for the talk. Based on my past experience of attending the colloquium, as participants have different background knowledge of Mathematics, it is hard for them to follow up if the topic is too advanced or assumed too much previous knowledge. It is just too easy for the audience to lose focus. So, I decided to introduce the basics and make the talk as self contained as possible, so that most participants can understand everything. This is the main reason why the slides took quite a while to complete - a lot of tailoring required. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The talk went really well. There are a lot of participants, around 10 if we exclude those who host the colloquium. This is quite a large number, as on average there are roughly 3 participants excluding the hosts each time. Among the audience, there are two biology / pharmacy professors of UCL who attended.  One of them, David Colquhoun, is even an FRS (Fellow of Royal Society) who collaborated with the statistician Alan Hawkes (the Hawkes of Hawkes Process) and contribute to the study ion channels. He and Hawkes collaborated a lot and worked heavily on Stochastic processes, but he said himself that Hawkes did most of the calculations. Not only that, there were a lot of engagements from the audience, and they said that they really enjoyed the talk. So it was quite a success I have to say. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I have put the slides <a href="../../notes/CollS/Colloquim.pdf">here</a> for those who are interested. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I started to generate a lot of interest to number theory after watching a video on introduction to diophantine equations and a documentary on Wiles’ proof to Fermat’s last theorem. I researched a bit, and discovered that in order to better study diophantine equations and the proof by Wiles, I have to learn this thing called “elliptic curves”. If I want to learn this, I need to learn a bit more of abstract algebra, then study some Galois theory and commutative algebra, and some basic number theory. It is not hard to see that a lot of prerequisite are required. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Apart from that, since I have been putting the focus on analysis, probability theory and statistics, I am quite weak on algebra (in comparison to these three branches), and I am not too familiar with number theory either. Previously, one extra homework sheet from my analysis class mentioned about algebraic numbers and transcendental numbers, and that got me quite curious about them. So I went to ask my lecturer of the analysis tutorial, who is also my personal tutor, about books that I can use to get a better understanding of the topics. He recommended me “An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers” by Hardy and Wright, and “Making Transcendence Transparent” for knowing a bit more about the transcendental numbers. I read a bit of them, which helps me to get some sort of familiarity of the topics. Anyway, despite that, there is still a long way to go for me to learn elliptic curves. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When I was learning these prerequisites, I realised a lot of the concepts in abstract algebra are very similar to the ones I learned in analysis. Some of the theorems and definitions gave me a strong sense of déjà vu. Because of that, I actually gained more insights about analysis from learning algebra, which is quite an unexpected surprise. To be fair, my previous way of imbalanced studying does drags my speed of learning, and which is why it is quite hard for me to study measure theory and real analysis.</p>

<h2 id="Wondering Years" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Wondering Years </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">These days, I have noticed that social groups are emerging at an increasing rate in the hall these days, and these social groups mostly consist of people with the same race or nationality. At the beginning of the term, there were still some mixing of people from different backgrounds, but as time progresses, that is decreasing. It is quite interesting to observe this asymptotic behaviour of the social groups in a small community like this. </p>
