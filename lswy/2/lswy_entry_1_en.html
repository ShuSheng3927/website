<h4 style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'" align="center">4 October 2020</h4>

<br>

<h2 id="London" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">London </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The weather in London these days have been quite nice. It is not too cold, about 15 degree Celsius on average for the past two weeks. Also, it is not that rainy during this period, only one or two days have been raining. Hope this kind of weather can continue. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The weather became worse the day right after I wrote the above paragraph. It has been raining for the entire day, and it is almost non-stop. This is going to last for the rest of this week and even early next week, according to the weather forecast.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When I was looking at the various places in London on the map before I came, I am somewhat fascinated by the number of ‘gardens’ they have. There seems to be one garden every 5km apart. When I went there, I realised it is a different story. Yes, there are a lot of gardens, but the idea of a garden in London is different from my assumptions. The gardens in Singapore, let’s say Botanic Garden or Chinese Garden are those huge regions of natural life. But here, a garden is just like a small park. The gardens near my, like Cartwright Garden, Russell Square, Bedford Square and such are all named after people, and there is often a bust of that person somewhere near one of the entrances. </p>


<h2 id="Statistics" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Statistics</h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This week is the first week of university, and most of the events are induction. Due to the pandemic, all events must be switched to online so there is little feeling of a ‘freshers week’. The academic side is still ongoing despite the pandemic. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">On Monday, there are three events hosted by the Mathematics department, from 9 am to noon, each takes an hour. The first one is a general introduction by the faculty, some more important faculty members gave a welcome and a short speech about their respective responsibilities. Nothing too extraordinary, and not a lot of new information. The second event is an hour-long Maths question session, where each member of the department came up and gave a question. The idea is wonderful in my opinion, however, due to the unfamiliarity of the online meeting, the sound quality was really bad, even to the point of non-existent. I will give them the credit of putting in effort and thoughts into making this session, but it is a fact that it did not turn out too well. The last session is a meeting among the transition group. The group has 11 members and 1 senior student who is supposed to be the mentor. Among the 11 members, 10 (including myself) are Chinese from the mainland, and the remaining one is from Poland and lives in the same accommodation as me. Most of the other Chinese students struggle to communicate in English, which makes the session a bit hard to carry on. This is supposed to last for one whole term and the meeting will take place weekly. However, I am not looking forward to this.</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">There are several events on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, but none are worth talking about here as they are more or less trivial and not important. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I have five modules this term, three from the Mathematics department and two from the Statistics department. For the Maths modules, I have Analysis 1, Algebra 1 and Method 1. The Analysis course is mostly basic Mathematical Analysis. The Algebra module is a mixture of abstract and linear algebra. The Method module this term is mostly on Calculus and some simple differential equations. For the Statistics modules, I have Introduction to Probability and Statistics and Introduction to Practical Statistics. To be fair, I am a lot more surprised about the content of my Statistics modules compare to the Mathematics ones - not saying the Mathematics ones are bad, just that they are standard. The Introduction to Probability and Statistics module has an interesting component, where the students need to read a research paper and write a summary about it. The paper is mostly written by the faculty members so we can also look for them directly if there are any issues. This is amazing, and it differentiates from self-studying, as you cannot find papers that are easier to understand and have people to ask about at the same time. I really like this design. For the Introduction to Practical Statistics module, it is essentially a module on R - the programming language for Statistics-related research. It is very useful in the real world, for both academia and industry. It is not hard to learn on my own, but it just makes things so much easier when you can just have a course on that. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">-</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Due to the pandemic, lectures of some modules are recorded and uploaded online. My Algebra module has the first four weeks (starting from next week) of lectures uploaded already, and the Analysis module has the first week’s lectures. This is actually unexpectedly good for me, as I can simply watch them at my own time, also with faster playback speed. I watch them with a playback speed of either 1.5 times or 2 times, and before the official time. It allows me to spend my time at other things that I need to do, like my own progress in studying and such. At the time of writing, I have already finished the first week’s material of Analysis and the first two weeks’ material of Algebra. The other modules have yet posted any recorded lectures, so I have to wait. I have to say, online learning is not that bad. Also, I have two problem classes that are face-to-face, I will talk more about it when I attend them myself next week. </p>

<h2 id="Wondering Years" style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Wondering Years </h2>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When I am here in London, I have been frequently asked the question of where I am from. I was seldom asked this kind of question in the past. Even when I was in Singapore, I look like any other Chinese kid so no one will even ask me that. It feels kind of strange. It is not that I did not expect this, but mostly due to another question arises form that. Am I that Chinese? It is about my identity. I have spent the first 13 years of my life in China, and the next 6 in Singapore. It is not hard to see that quite a significant portion of my life was spent in Singapore, and I do not feel that ‘purely’ Chinese. So it does feel slightly weird whenever I answer that question. </p>
