<h4 style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'" align="center">1 January 2021</h4>


<br>


<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">2020 is the first year that I started learning rigorous Mathematics. After I graduated from high school at the end of 2019, I began reading some college level Mathematics texts. That was also the time that I started switching my focus to broadly Mathematics (including Statistics). The main motivation I had back then was to chase up my peers who had focused on Mathematics at an earlier stage. I always know their existences, like those people who were doing Olympic Mathematics were spending a lot more time on Mathematics than I did. To be fair, ever since I stopped doing Olympic Mathematics (roughly in the middle of my Middle school years), I have not learned any new Mathematics. The Mathematics covered in high school were already studied a while ago, and most of my time during the two years of high school were spent on extracurricular activities, leaderships and computer science related things. I would not say they are a waste of my time, but it is true that I have been stagnated for a long while on the Mathematics front.
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Under that situation, I could not wait but to start learning Mathematics. Just like the Renaissance period, people will be in some sort of fanaticism after a period of scarcity. I was driven by a similar fanaticism too. I read a lot of Mathematical texts, I began to understand what real Mathematics is, and I started to write my own notes. I was having an abundance of passion. The epidemic made me stay at home, and I had the perfect excuse for unwanted socialisation (like visiting relatives that I do not even know the name of, or meeting up with long-forgotten classmates from a long time ago). I was in control of all the time I had. I slowly realised how naive and superficial my understanding of Mathematics was (of course, it is not much better now), and I slowly had my own feelings for it. That kind of days lasted for eight months, all the way until I left for London. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I went to UK in the middle of September. Although I was aware about the situation of epidemic there, I was clear that I could not carry out my studying properly if I stay in China. I predicted that the internet will be a huge issue when University began, which would ultimately destroy my experience of learning. Although, due to time difference, a lot of things will tend to chaos. Along with several other minor reasons, I made up my mind on going to UK. Thinking back, I still believe that was a right decision.
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">At the start of the term, I was still a bit hesitant of doing academia or finance after I finish my undergraduate study. I did not have a clear idea, and I was planning to discover more. There were a lot of finance related events and presentations. I went to all of them, but they bored me a lot. These bankers were constantly repeating the same nonsense, and there was no valuable opinions or insights. Other peers who participated in those events were trying their best to squeeze into the cubicles of the skyscrapers of City of London and Canary Wharf. They were making every effort to have build good relationships with those bankers, expecting some of their words or recommendations would land them an opportunity for internship and a “brighter” future. I was not a fan of it, was sick of it in fact. Life is so short and precious. Why are we spending the best years of our life on flatteries? Why do we not chase for things that are beautiful and immortal? Even hedonism and indulgence felt more moral to me, at least people were possessing their own fate at those instances. It was at the same time that I had a better realisation of the beauty of Mathematics, and its multitudes. Since I have the opportunity to do Mathematics, a lot of passion for it, and so much opportunities and resources at London and UCL, what reason do I have to not do it? That was why I decided to focus on Mathematics, and specifically pure Mathematics. That was the second month after the start of term. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The following two months were spent entirely on Mathematics. I was also purposing reducing the time I spent on school work. The things covered in class were too simple for me. I do not find the point of spending over ten hours per week to watch the recording of the lectures, and I would not learn anything new from them. I will know what was taught from reading the notes. There were not a lot of homework either. At the beginning I would do all the optional exercises in addition to the compulsory ones, but I think those were not essential and too time-consuming. I would stop after finishing the compulsory ones. Except from the occasional minor mistakes, I got everything correct for my homework. This way, I got a lot of time every week to spend on my own studying following to my own pace. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">With this seemingly abundance of time, I would spend my breaks (like during meals or after meals) watching the interviews of many Mathematicians and listen to how they describe the Mathematics they are doing. In the end, I think the Mathematics done by Peter Sarnak (at least according to his own descriptions) is the same as the Mathematics I want to do. When he was asked upon what field of Mathematics he was doing, he replied that he had no field, and his field would be “Mathematics” if there has to be one. He would learn from multiple branches and tried to draw connections between some of them. He would try to use tools and methods from one branch to solve the problems of the other. I think that is uniform from what I believe to be beautiful Mathematics. I was watching a video on Diophantine equations and that was the first time I realised we can combine tools from algebra, analysis and geometry to solve a problem of number theory. Although everything involved in that video was elementary, I never though these things could be combined to solve a problem. I was excited and shocked when I was watching that video, and found all the Mathematics I studied beforehand dull. Those things helped me to have a very rough idea of what kind of Mathematics I wanted to do, which allowed me to better plan my studying. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">If I want to do this kind of Mathematics, it means I need to have good understanding of multiple branches instead of focusing on one too early and neglect everything else. I have to have a very solid foundation, and sufficient knowledge in the main branches of Algebra, Analysis, Geometry and Topology. Based on what I know, most people would at most have good knowledge in one of these three branches at the end of undergraduate. However, I want to, and need to, have that for all three of them. Good knowledge means that I need to know at least commutative algebra and Lie algebra for Algebra branch, minimum functional analysis and PDE, maybe with some harmonic analysis for Analysis, and Riemann Geometry for the last branch. Apart from those, I would need to learn Number Theory, and both the algebraic one and the analytic one. Elliptic curves and algebraic geometry are things I want to learn too. In addition to those, I want to learn things like combinatorics and graph theory, probability, and complex system. That seem to be a lot of material (they are indeed), but as I learn more, I would learn faster (I am already experiencing this from my current studying), and I do have quite some time. I am only at the first year of my undergraduate.
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">These days I have learned a lot. I am familiar with the basic group theory in Algebra and need some more familiarity for ring. I was learning Algebra for over a month back then and I needed to do something else, so I did something else afterwards. For analysis, I am learning complex analysis now. I have good familiarity with mathematical analysis already. Maybe I will spend some time to reinforce on the multivariable calculus things. For topology and geometry, I am learning manifolds now. I am quite pleased with my current progress. Apart form learning, I gave a talk too, which was on an interesting result I learned over the holiday on probability theory. Many people came and it went quite well, which is a good start for my “academic career”.
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Everything seems to be going smoothly, but problems do exist. There are times that I felt down, especially when I had nothing to do after one full day of Mathematics. Also, I felt uncomfortable when I meet people after long day of Mathematics, and I wanted to escape as soon as I can. Later on, I realised that was because I was getting “empty” inside. I was not thinking about anything other than Mathematics, and I have nothing other than Mathematics. That was unsettling. Back in high school I would often think about random things. I would think about the current events, the advancements in technology, the past and future of mankind, and some surface-level philosophy. I was not only thinking about them alone, but I also had people to discuss such things with. But I had none of those at those times, and know few people who are talk about these things with. Among the limited socialising I had, I felt most people here are unsophisticated and almost no thoughts beyond the trivial pass their minds. I hope that was my own bias and illusions, but I do no think that is the case. I stopped studying Mathematics for the first few days after the end of first term and began to read some novels. I was not reading anything sophisticated, just some work of Kundera and Murakami. These things filled my void outside Mathematics, and calmed me down.  
</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">A lot of people seem to be having a lot of expectations for the new year. I feel the over-emphasis of the future is due to the overwhelming unsatisfactory of the present. I do not have much “new year goals”, or much anticipating for the coming year. I do not every have much desire to write this summary, but I still wrote it as there are quite a lot of say. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">All the promises and bold words at the start of last year felt overly sarcastic now. I do not wish, and even felt afraid, to have much hope for the new year and be too optimistic about the future. I hope there are less pain and suffering (not only of myself but to everyone) this year. I wish, at this golden era of my life, my desires and curiosity do not escape too soon, leaving me with merely a living carcass.
