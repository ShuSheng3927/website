<h2 id="Purpose of Writing">Purpose of Writing</h2>
<p>As someone who is slightly obsessed with writing down and recording thoughts and activities, it is only natural to have bits and pieces whenever something new come across me in my life. Since I am going to start my undergraduate study and I am going to do that in a new city, country and continent, I think there will be a lot of interesting (at least to me) things and thoughts going on. This will be a series, or rather a compilation, of notes and remarks I write down during this period of time. </p>

<p>My obsession of writing down my thoughts is one reason, and another main reason is to share my experience with others who are in a similar position or wanting to know more about these things, like studying in a new country alone, learning Statistics, going through early adulthood etc. I am very grateful for the information I received when I was deciding on the next stages of my life, as they are (mostly) honest and from the bottom of the authors’ heart. However, there does not seem to be sufficient amount to clear all my doubts. So I hope by writing my own experience and sharing them, maybe some readers will clear their own doubts or enjoy whatever information I present. It will be the utmost delight and honour  to know if my (almost) random combination of alphabets is bringing people, regardless the number, joy and knowledge.  </p>

<p>The other main reason of writing these things down is to share with my family, friends, and whoever is curious (in a positive way of course) about what is going on in my life. If others actively thought about and care about you, it will be rather rude and ungrateful to refuse to share with them. Since I hate repetition and information without proper order, writing them down in a solid text, like this, will be my preferred way of updating my life to these lovely people. </p>

<h2 id="Categories">Categories</h2>
<p>As the title may have already suggested, the three key themes of these texts  are ‘London’, ‘Statistics’ and ‘the Wondering Years’. My texts will be categorised into one or a few of these three categories. ‘London’, the city of my university, will be the category for things that have strong connections with the city, such as my observations of London. ‘Statistics’, my major, will be about all the academic and work related information, and probably some of my thoughts on the discipline. ‘The Wondering Years’ will be the thoughts I have on more general matters which do not strictly fall into the two previous categories. </p>

<h2 id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous </h2>
<p>One of my key principles of the writing such texts is to be as honest as possible. The information should be as truthful and accurate as possible in order to bring any values and reflect anything useful. The down-side of being honest is that I may not wish to share all of them with others, as some are more intimate to me which I do not want to reveal to most others. Also, some may not be public to avoid any potential conflicts or issues. I hope to be as far away as possible from any unwanted controversies. </p>

<p>Also, when I revised the things after finishing them, I will only make amendments to the writing style and fix some grammar issues. I will aim to leave the ideas as raw as possible, which means it is possible that I refute my own ideas at a later stage. This is by no means being hypocritical, but merely to illustrate the process. </p>

<p>Another remark is that the texts will be written in English at first, and translated into Mandarin afterwards. This is due to the fact that I am more comfortable and natural with writing down such things in English, and some of the main target audience are fluent in Mandarin but not English. </p>

<p>The texts will be originally ordered numerically from 0, and when they are shown to the public they will be ordered by the date of composition. The numerical order is for my own reference, and the later way of ordering is just due to the fact that some information are hidden from the public.  </p>

<p>Fame and financial rewards, although crossed my mind when I am planning about this project, are never my purpose of writing this series. For fame, I have always tried to minimise as I am uncomfortable with all the side-effects of being under the spotlight. For financial rewards, I am happy to receive those but they should only be the byproducts of my writing. I am writing to share knowledge and my experience, not to gain money from the readers.</p>

<h2 id="Final Words">Final Words</h2>
<p>This text will be dedicated to myself. More precisely, the various versions of myself when I write down each and every text along the way. This collection is my gift to the future me to look back to, to laugh at, and to cherish.</p>

<p>This text will also be dedicated to people that came before us, for their contributions and sacrifices that we often take for granted. Hopefully I can be a part of them for the future generations. </p>
