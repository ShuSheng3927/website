<h4 style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'" align="center">13 September 2020</h4>

<br>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Due to the structure of the education system of my high school, I graduated in November. However, the start dates of Universities in most parts of the world are in either September and October. This means I will have around 9 months of break between the end of high school and the start of university. This extremely long duration of time is more than enough for me to accomplish many things. So naturally, I have set several targets for myself, which I have mostly achieved when I am writing this text. Briefly, they are <span><a 
href="#t1">(1)</a></span> go through (roughly) the content of first year’s courses <span><a 
href="#t2" id="QQ2-1-7">(2)</a></span> be in good health conditions, especially in the aspect of weight and sleeping pattern (3) have a better understanding of what my future should be (4) read more books. In the following paragraphs, I will go more in detail on each of these four targets and how well I have achieved them. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This will be split into two entries as it is quite long. This part will cover the first two points, and the next two points in the second part.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'" id="t1">Target 1</h3>


<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">My courses, as the degree title ‘BSc Mathematics and Statistics’ may have already suggested, is split almost evenly between Mathematics and Statistics. So, the main topics that will be covered in my first year are (1) Calculus and Analysis (2) Algebra, both Abstract and Linear (3) Elementary Probability Theory (4) Basic Statistics. The first two are under Mathematics and the later two are under Statistics. My studying did not follow strictly to this structure, but they cover most, if not more, of the required content. The aim of this is to have a solid understanding of what might come and to have a head start among my peers of this course. In addition, this is mainly aimed to catch up with the potential more advanced peers of my cohort, not necessarily the cohort in terms of school, but of a broader scale. Also, since I will be learning these things when I go to University and I do not intend to skip too many classes, I will focus on grasping the concepts rather than working too much on the technicalities and such. As these fundamental topics (especially the Math ones) can be and should be learned many times, it will not be a waste of effort or a repetition of work to start now. Moreover, when I say I have ‘studied’ or ‘learned’ or ‘finished’ something here, it does not mean I have understood every detail of that topic, but rather a roughly 60 to 70 percent understanding of the material. It will be arrogant and inaccurate for me to say that I have understood any of these topics. Okay, more than enough background information, here is what I have learned, in chronological order of my studying. </p>


<ul style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'"><li>  Introduction to Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang 
</li></ul>


<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This is the first book I studied after the end of high school. I did not have a single clue of where I will be going for University and what exactly I will be studying since my IB results was yet to come out and I have not received any offers yet. So I thought since I will need to learn Linear Algebra regardless of the course I get in the end, it will not be too bad of an idea to do linear algebra first. I got a second-hand but mostly new copy of the latest edition of this when I was still in Singapore and I started flipping through it. I read most of it when I went back to Shanghai after my IB exams and other school-related events. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This book is alright, and the MIT online course by Prof. Strang based on this book are alright too. I read and watched through them, learned something new and that’s it. I did not think I have learned much from it nor did I know better on what linear algebra is about. My knowledge of Linear Algebra and Mathematics in general was insufficient to better appreciate the content of that book and online course, which is why this book brings minimum impact to me. Anyway, this is the first book I did. </p>


<ul style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'"><li>  Linear Algebra Done Right - Sheldon Axler
</li></ul>


<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I started this somewhere in January 2020 when I went back to Singapore from Shanghai to collect my IB result. Between that time and the time I finished the first book, I have spent most of my time reading (non-Math) books, which will be discussed later on. In addition to my reading, I have researched more on good Math textbooks for different Mathematics courses, and I have had a better understanding of what college level Mathematics are. I got most of these information on this Chinese forum called Zhihu, and it is also from there that I have learned about this book. So somehow I got a copy of it online and started reading it. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">A lot of things happened while I was reading this book. I got terribly sick in late December, and it took me a few weeks to recover. I received my IB result which was expected and satisfactory to me. Several changes happened to my personal life and people around me. I got rejected from many schools, including ones that I really wanted to go. I got accepted by UCL, which is the second best course among the ones I applied. I went to various places in Shanghai to see what is going on back home. And of course, the coronavirus broke out in China and total lockdown began. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">While so many things happened, I still managed to find time to read this book. This is quite an important book to me, since it is the first rigorous and ‘proper Mathematics’ book that I read. I started to get used to the ‘Definition-Theorem-Proof-Example-Corollary’ kind of structure and have a better understanding of what proper Mathematics is, which was extremely different from the ones I have ever learned before. This did make me feel overwhelmingly ignorant but at the same time astonished. My understanding of the content of this book is too limited and I would very much want to revisit this book at a later stage, maybe when I take linear algebra courses in Uni. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Oh, and apart from all these takeaways, I picked up ‘LaTeX’ and wrote my notes of this book using that, encouraged by my friend Chris. </p>


<ul style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'"><li>  Principles of Mathematical Analysis - Walter Rudin
</li></ul>


<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This is another important book. Actually, I should stop saying that because almost every Math books I read are important. I started this book right after I finish the previous one. At this stage, I have already known that I will need to study Analysis for college. Also, from my research, many people recommended this book and said this is a great book to learn Analysis from. But only at a much later stage, I noticed that this is a great book only for those who have already studied Analysis. This is a good second book, but not really the best first book. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I struggled a lot when I was reading this book - the material is very dense and a lot of steps are skipped. Especially for chapter 2 of the book, it is so hard to understand that I have to copy everything on a piece of paper to force me to read them. I was really motivated at that time to learn more and somehow I managed to go through most of the book. I did not do the exercises back then, and I started slowly doing them these days. It was quite a painful experience since I also had some tutoring work to do during that period. But this is undoubtedly rewarding, and I got a lot better at seeing the missing steps and understanding those ‘obviously’. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I took a two-week break after I finished this as I was burned out. I spent those two weeks staying away from Maths as much as I can. Most of the time I am watching TV shows and playing video games. At the end of the break I regained most of my motivation and started working again. </p>

<ul style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'"><li>  Elementary Probability Theory - Chung Kai Lai
</li></ul>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">At this stage, I have finished the pure Math prerequisite for elementary Probability Theory and Statistics. So I started on this book on Probability Theory. I have learned some of the content back in high school already so this is not too hard, especially when you compare it with baby rudin (Nickname for Principles of Mathematical Analysis). </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The syntax and notation of the book is a bit outdated when I compare with more recent information of the topic online. Also, this book has a lot more math than other elementary probability theory textbooks. For the parts on Stochastic processes like Poisson Processes, Random Walk and Markov Chain, I think the explanations are really clear and understandable. Of course it will be better if there are less equations and more word explanations, but the current state is still good enough. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I do not think I will recommend this book as a first probability theory textbook. There are many other books out there like the one by Sheldon Ross, which are way less mathematical but still give an idea of what is going on. I referred to many other textbooks while reading this myself. Maybe I was just not good enough to appreciate the extra Mathematical details, that could very much be the case. </p>

<ul style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'"><li>  Statistical Inference - George Casella 
</li></ul>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">This is quite a thick book and covered almost all topics of Statistics at undergraduate level. I did not read the last few chapters, like the ones on Asymptotic and Linear Models, since I think there are other books that discuss these topics at a greater depth and also I was a bit tired when I was at those chapters. Many times while reading the book, I wondered why some ideas are introduced and I failed to understand the applications to them. Things get clearer when I read further and refer to other sources. Some people online said that you should not aim to understand every detail when you read it at the first go since things will only become clear when you read more. I suppose that is the case. Also, I realised I always wonder about the applications to theories, or else they will be a bit strange and hard to grasp. When I have a good understanding of why these tools are invented or these definitions are made, I will immediately get why things are the way they are. Maybe it is because I am more ‘applied’ than others, or maybe it is just the way it is. Regardless, I started looking out for background information when I learn new concepts from then onwards, and it make learning a bit easier than before. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">I do not quite like the order of content of this book. However, in terms of coverage of topics, this book does a good job. </p>

<ul style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'"><li>  Other
</li></ul>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">When I finished Statistical Inference in May, I have more or less covered the material for my first years courses. There are some remaining topics but they can be picked up fairly easily. My target before I started doing all these learning was achieved. Because of that, my motivation dropped significantly. I took a break from Maths, and I started again in a month’s time. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">After the break, I have been starting on new books, mostly books on measure theory and measure theoretic probability theory. I used Tao’s Introduction to Measure Theory to have a brief understanding of measure theory so I will not be too lost when I read the advanced probability theory textbook. For the measure theoretic probability theory, I have bought and used many books in parallel. I have Durrett’s Probability Theory and Examples, William’s Probability and Martingale and Bilingsley’s Probability and Measure. Each of the three have their own style and slight differences. For example, William spends more time on Martingale while the other two do not. I am currently using Durrett’s book as the main one. In addition, I have picked up Artin’s Algebra to have some understanding of Abstract Algebra and some revision for Linear Algebra. I do enjoy Artin’s choice of combining both Abstract and Linear Algebra as they are somewhat connected. Things like isomorphism and span can be understood better if we look at it from the Abstract Algebra point of view. Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to finish any of these books before Uni starts. I will continue with them later on. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Apart from reading textbooks, I have started a new project. I have started to write my own notebook. The notebook is somewhat like a textbook, but it does not cover much examples and exercise. Instead, explanations, background stories, and personal understanding of topics are included. The main purpose of writing the notebook is to refresh my memory and to help with my own understanding when I revise these earlier topics. I am currently working on the notebook for elementary Probability Theory and Statistics. I have completed the first part, Probability Theory and they can be viewed using the <a href="https://shusheng3927.github.io/website/notes/SPT1/SPT1.html">link</a>. I will update again when I finish the Statistics component. I am not fully confident about the content yet, as I am not too satisfied with some parts of it, and I am think I need to learn further to come up with a more satisfactory version. Although it is ‘elementary’, it actually should cover the first two years’ material on both Probability Theory and Statistics for Math or Stat majors. I am planning to write more such notebooks when I finish with the current one. I will write one for more elementary Analysis, one for measure theoretic Probability Theory and Statistics and one for more advanced Analysis. Maybe I will write one for Stochastic Calculus, but that is way ahead and we shall think about that only when the time comes. </p>


<h3 id="t2"style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times'">Target 2</h3>
<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">Regarding my physical health, I have been working on it since the end of my IB exams. As I have mentioned earlier, I caught some sort of flu in December 2019 and it took at least four weeks to recover. That was a really awful experience, which motivates me to work on my physical health. Also, the frequent news on people dying at a much younger age these days due to heavy workload is a constant reminder of the importance of health. In addition, I was not in very good shape by the end of IB exams since I eat too much snacks (mostly Snickers and Oreos) to get rid of some of the stress. All in all, I have more than enough reasons to get serious about my health.</p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">The two major problems are my weight and my sleeping pattern. Both were not too bad, just as a matter of fact, but they can surely be worked on. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">In terms of weight, the key concept of weight loss is the following equation: Input - Output = Retained. In words, the difference between the things you eat and the energy you use will be the amount that stay in your body, in the form of fat. Not the most accurate description of the whole process but this is definitely close enough. So, I work on decreasing the input by controlling the amount I eat and the kind I eat. At the same time, I exercise more to increase the output as well as improving the functions of my cardiovascular system. The result was not too bad. At the time I write this text I am in relatively good health condition, if you examine it via ‘BMI’ and whatnot. </p>

<p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times'">For sleeping patterns, I would say I did not do too well at first. In the first half of the holiday, I usually fall asleep around midnight to 1 am, and wake up around 10 am. I slept enough, but not the best possible interval of time to sleep. Many people wondered whether the interval matters at all in terms of having good sleep. The answer, according to the recent research, is yes. The reason behind that has something to do with sunlight and the chemicals human bodies produce when they see sunlight. I could not remember the details but if anyone is interested, the book “Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker is a good source. For the second half of the holiday, I took this problem more seriously. The main reason for the change was I went for a body check and the results said I have nodules around my thyroids. It was mainly due to some issues with hormones and somewhat caused by irregular or bad sleeping pattern. It was quite a serious issue at the first sight, which scared me a lot. I decided to take quite actions and adjusted my sleeping pattern immediately. Although after a more detailed checking it was a false alarm, I did take sleeping pattern more seriously and they have been quite good since then. </p>
